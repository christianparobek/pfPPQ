## In submission to GBE, a reviewer noted that Menard et al
## identified SNPs in CRT, but that they found that satisfactory
## coverage across CRT was difficult to achieve. We want to see 
## if we have coverage at these sites in CRT.
## To save space, I deleted the individual HC VCFs that I made
## off which I called the miotto backbone. All those paths to GATK
## have since changed and it would be difficult to get up and running
## at this point, so going with an easier but likely just as reliable
## solution: subset the bams and eyeball them in IGV.
## RESULT: No SNPs at CRT 97, 343, or 353.
## Search for "menard" in my pfPPQ GitHub page for more info.
